# Computer-Generated Music for Tabletop Role-Playing Games

This repository contains the source code to reproduce the results of the [AIIDE'20](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~santanad/aiide/)
paper [Computer-Generated Music for Tabletop Role-Playing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07009).
This paper presents *Bardo Composer*, a system to generate background music for tabletop role-playing games. Bardo Composer uses a 
speech recognition system to translate player speech into text, which is classified according to a model of emotion. Bardo Composer 
then uses Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search, a variant of Stochastic Beam Search that we introduce in this paper, with a neural 
model to generate musical pieces conveying the desired emotion.
