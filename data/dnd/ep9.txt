our heroes faced with an oncoming force:calm
have decided to venture out into the:calm
wilderness to find allies beasts:calm
monsters animals that lay within the:calm
land to help them in their babble today:calm
they must face the oncoming force where:calm
we left off you guys just managed to:calm
tame an out there through brands heroic:calm
actions of stripping himself of all his:calm
armor and straight-up wrestling the:calm
albear to the ground he put them into:calm
submission so quickly that I didn't even:calm
expect it to happen that fast but it did:calm
it happened and now you guys have an:calm
earth elemental and an al bear on your:calm
side as well as tick attack the cool:calm
little lizard Bros and Olga the super:calm
butch barbarian lady with an axe:calm
the al bear is named hoo-dee-hoo as per:calm
its own:calm
I guess the decision night I forget:calm
exactly its own fate to say yeah it was:calm
on his own fake decision and then TomTom:calm
the earth elemental as which no key:calm
named it little TomTom Darion doesn't:calm
know that yeah I'm a portal you hear:calm
that for the record after a bad after I:calm
realized I forgot my armor on the ground:calm
I went and picked it back up I ran back:calm
oh yeah put that gun solid move word on:calm
the street is that there are some people:calm
who want your blood just like you wanted:suspense
theirs in the last part of the campaign:suspense
they are not going to stop until they:suspense
get there they get what is theirs and:suspense
what is theirs is your blood they won't:suspense
with what we disagree that Bloods my:suspense
blood there happens to be a slight:suspense
disagreement on whose blood it is:suspense
I think our rolling death squad is ready:suspense
I think we're ready to roll and we're:suspense
going to go to find this army:suspense
all right everybody here we're closed:suspense
and I imagine we'll find the army within:suspense
an hour so starting right now and:suspense
casting backs without a trace what does:suspense
that do we all now get +10 bonuses to:suspense
our staff choice that's incredible:suspense
and you're gonna need it because the:suspense
extra hoops you have to jump through to:suspense
gain nature's allies have cost you time:suspense
in this uncoming battle so you can:suspense
expect the enemy to be at least one step:suspense
ahead of you so Oliver has keen sight I:suspense
suggest perhaps I'll bear make his way:suspense
for the woods investigate it was pretty:suspense
stealthy in the past especially when:suspense
people have arm it was actually really:suspense
stealthy we didn't see him and now he'll:suspense
probably be incredibly stealthy okay:suspense
I'll let I'll let you deal with talking:suspense
him because you guys have a little:suspense
relationship going on that I don't know:suspense
nothing I don't I can't I can't talk:suspense
hose oh yeah I'm like I touched that:suspense
started to find what we have yeah mmm:suspense
you don't need to put leaders on:suspense
everything hootie-hoo it looks at you:suspense
and says pretty who is it's an L bear:suspense
all right be the stealthiest you can be:suspense
and go and see if there's any army up:suspense
there it goes and does that exact same:suspense
thing with its +10 stealth that you've:suspense
now granted it correct mm yeah I'm gonna:suspense
also stealth out uh what time of day is:suspense
it can you like me give me an idea 5:00:suspense
p.m. 5:00 p.m.:suspense

me the weather and what it will be like:suspense
the next 24 hours it manifests itself in:suspense
a little visual representation a small:suspense
snow globe appears before you and within:suspense
it is not snow but clear daylight so I'm:suspense
