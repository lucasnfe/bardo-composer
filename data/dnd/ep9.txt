our heroes faced with an oncoming force:1,0
have decided to venture out into the:1,0
wilderness to find allies beasts:1,0
monsters animals that lay within the:1,0
land to help them in their babble today:1,0
they must face the oncoming force where:1,0
we left off you guys just managed to:1,0
tame an out there through brands heroic:1,0
actions of stripping himself of all his:1,0
armor and straight-up wrestling the:1,0
albear to the ground he put them into:1,0
submission so quickly that I didn't even:1,0
expect it to happen that fast but it did:1,0
it happened and now you guys have an:1,0
earth elemental and an al bear on your:1,0
side as well as tick attack the cool:1,0
little lizard Bros and Olga the super:1,0
butch barbarian lady with an axe:1,0
the al bear is named hoo-dee-hoo as per:1,0
its own:1,0
I guess the decision night I forget:1,0
exactly its own fate to say yeah it was:1,0
on his own fake decision and then TomTom:1,0
the earth elemental as which no key:1,0
named it little TomTom Darion doesn't:1,0
know that yeah I'm a portal you hear:1,0
that for the record after a bad after I:1,0
realized I forgot my armor on the ground:1,0
I went and picked it back up I ran back:1,0
oh yeah put that gun solid move word on:1,0
the street is that there are some people:1,0
who want your blood just like you wanted:0,0
theirs in the last part of the campaign:0,0
they are not going to stop until they:0,0
get there they get what is theirs and:0,0
what is theirs is your blood they won't:0,0
with what we disagree that Bloods my:0,0
blood there happens to be a slight:0,0
disagreement on whose blood it is:0,0
I think our rolling death squad is ready:0,0
I think we're ready to roll and we're:0,0
going to go to find this army:0,0
all right everybody here we're closed:0,0
and I imagine we'll find the army within:0,0
an hour so starting right now and:0,0
casting backs without a trace what does:0,0
that do we all now get +10 bonuses to:0,0
our staff choice that's incredible:0,0
and you're gonna need it because the:0,0
extra hoops you have to jump through to:0,0
gain nature's allies have cost you time:0,0
in this uncoming battle so you can:0,0
expect the enemy to be at least one step:0,0
ahead of you so Oliver has keen sight I:0,0
suggest perhaps I'll bear make his way:0,0
for the woods investigate it was pretty:0,0
stealthy in the past especially when:0,0
people have arm it was actually really:0,0
stealthy we didn't see him and now he'll:0,0
probably be incredibly stealthy okay:0,0
I'll let I'll let you deal with talking:0,0
him because you guys have a little:0,0
relationship going on that I don't know:0,0
nothing I don't I can't I can't talk:0,0
hose oh yeah I'm like I touched that:0,0
started to find what we have yeah mmm:0,0
you don't need to put leaders on:0,0
everything hootie-hoo it looks at you:0,0
and says pretty who is it's an L bear:0,0
all right be the stealthiest you can be:0,0
and go and see if there's any army up:0,0
there it goes and does that exact same:0,0
thing with its +10 stealth that you've:0,0
now granted it correct mm yeah I'm gonna:0,0
also stealth out uh what time of day is:0,0
it can you like me give me an idea 5:00:0,0
p.m. 5:00 p.m.:0,0
oh I'm gonna sit back and be like:0,0
I'm a castle spell Oh the spell - tells:0,0
me the weather and what it will be like:0,0
the next 24 hours it manifests itself in:0,0
a little visual representation a small:0,0
snow globe appears before you and within:0,0
it is not snow but clear daylight so I'm:0,0
gonna stuff my way forward:0,0
I guess the Alber will also stealth his:0,0
way forward I'm going to summarize okay:0,0
it's a natural 20 Maddie for me boys:0,0
so the albear does its darndest to sneak:0,0
into these woods:0,0
