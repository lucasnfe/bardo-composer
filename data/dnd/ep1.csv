185.4,3.78,destiny but I ignore my shortcomings in,1,0
187.41,4.859,my failures along the way my character,1,0
189.18,6.23,he is a human ranger his name is daryun,1,0
192.269,6.78,no he is a hunter he hunts and kills,1,0
195.41,6.19,animals for the tribe and he is really,1,0
199.049,4.891,good Archer so pretty valuable I'd say,1,0
201.6,5.07,to a small tribe like this I have one,1,0
203.94,3.6,wife and her name is Mira and she was,1,0
206.67,3.03,actually my bond,1,0
207.54,4.38,I love Mira more than anything in this,1,0
209.7,6.12,whole world but I use it but Longo and,1,0
211.92,5.55,too short swords I generally yeah I've,1,0
215.82,6.21,used two short swords on my back till,1,0
217.47,6.78,you cut your hair just so my personality,1,0
222.03,3.69,trait is my character he never relies on,1,0
224.25,3.66,other people he generally just relies,1,0
225.72,4.53,himself to do things and get things done,1,0
227.91,5.609,and my flaw for my character is that I,1,0
230.25,6.42,distrust absolutely anyone I don't know,1,0
233.519,4.47,oh so my character is basically the,1,0
236.67,2.35,druid of the tribe,1,0
237.989,6.521,his name is No,1,0
239.02,8.01,kee Mao and ohk I basically he lives in,1,0
244.51,3.78,a tree more or less but it's like,1,0
247.03,2.64,hollowed out in the bottom there's kind,1,0
248.29,3.69,of been a hut expanded from with the,1,0
249.67,4.77,tree that I live in was planted when I,1,0
251.98,4.77,was a baby and therefore mean that tree,1,0
254.44,3.99,share a bond is the tree out here yes,1,0

262.39,2.55,the tree is not right next to that camp,1,0
263.59,2.61,well that's why you've came back to camp,1,0
264.94,2.55,here is because I would never let,1,0
266.2,3.32,something build a campfire that close to,1,0
267.49,5.19,my treat okay well it was probably just,1,0
269.52,4.18,this tree over so protective of its tree,1,0
272.68,2.28,I'm really protective of the street,1,0
273.7,4.92,because that tree is my bond,1,0
