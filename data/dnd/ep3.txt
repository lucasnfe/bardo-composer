good evening and welcome to another:1,0
night of Dungeons & Dragons with LAN:1,0
party in the last chapter of the story:1,0
bran managed to find his son who has now:1,0
been purchased by wealthy farmers and:1,0
landowners in this next section of the:1,0
campaign they will try to inch closer to:1,0
the mystery of the whereabouts of brands:1,0
wife and the mystery of what in the darn:1,0
heck these darn civilized societies are:1,0
trying to do with their dang land see:1,0
what happens:0,0
it's starting to hit midnight so all who:0,0
knows what kind of untold Horrors might:0,0
be beset upon right now so because I:0,0
mind let's move up to this uh smoovies:0,0
bridge that's the calmest way to say my:0,0
wife is probably being murdered right:0,0
now may we please go in like continue:0,0
our twists unkilled words until the:0,0
horrors are happening to her I'm gonna:0,0
stealth up to this point right here:0,0
alright crawling and then I'm gonna peek:0,0
up right about here I'm gonna look:0,0
around this area uh currently you don't:0,0
listen you don't really see exactly what:0,0
this guy is up to from that line of:0,0
sight okay because it's higher:0,0
undisclosed reasons um and what you see:0,0
is on the other side of the river here:0,0
you see the merchant and this soldier:0,0
getting all buddy-buddy and you see a:0,0
slave basically just doing a menial task:0,0
of like restocking boxes:0,0
what's up of this guy's this kind of God:0,0
there's a guy on top of these ruins:0,0
holding the lantern and he is just kind:0,0
of casually peering out into the:0,0
darkness he's kind of standing watch for:0,0
the training posts for the event and:0,0
then there's a guard over there there's:0,0
guard in front of the tent the tavern:0,0

until the spell ends anything the target:0,0
is wearing or carrying it's invisible as:0,0
long as it is on your person how broken:0,0
the spell ends for a target that attacks:0,0
or casts a spell:0,0

from the hills:0,1
it says the guy in gold he's got a very:0,1
deep voice he's got long flowy hair he:0,1
looks very regal he looks like a paladin:0,1
kind of difficult looking paladin if you:0,1
know what I mean like level wise not:0,1
intimidating a little bit in fact and he:0,1
looks directly to your character nieces:0,1
a lowly savage from the hills and he:0,1
rolls a to intimidation Shack and he's:0,1
he's like a seventh from the hills and:0,1
doesn't faze you at all and then his:0,1
cleric friend speaks up I knew that they:0,1
would be coming down at some point after:0,1
families he's actually spent his round:0,1
saying a little bit more than just words:0,1
he's going to say that and he's also:0,1
going to include in it a spell and:0,1
suddenly just whirls happen around him:0,1
and what you see is you see what looks:0,1
like to be demons hugging him they're:0,1
like orbiting around him swooping around:0,1
him like ghosts seem to be kind of:0,1
making what looks to be like a:0,1
supernatural barrier around him all:0,1
right so gold shield hey guess what you:0,1
