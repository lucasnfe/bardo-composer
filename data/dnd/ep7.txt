tonight we continue the call of the wild:1,0
Dungeons & Dragons campaign if you're:1,0
new to this campaign don't worry because:1,0
I'm about to explain everything that:1,0
just happened where we last left off a:1,0
small village comprised of brand:1,0
nokey and Darien have had their village:1,0
attacked by a invading Society they've:1,0
decided in vengeance to take back the:1,0
land that is rightfully theirs:1,0
slaughtering farmhouses:1,0
civilians and even going so far as to:1,0
killing the mayor of the very land in:1,0
which they reside tonight they must:1,0
decide what to do with an enraged:1,0
society that wants vengeance against:1,0
them now they must confront the allies:1,0
that reside in the woods nearby who all:1,0
want to take part in their fight so:1,0
really quick before we even begin just:1,0
as a heads up that little caged in area:1,0
right there treat that is something:1,0
that's separate and distant from:1,0
everything else you see on the map:1,0
because that is the home tree the big:1,0
old tree right there that's Nico's home:1,0
tree okay nice tree man so dude it took:1,0
me a long time to grow it yeah where we:1,0
last left off was you guys raided the:1,0
mayor's house during a private event:1,0
Ernest you busted and slaughtered a:1,0
bunch of guards and slaughtered the:1,0
mayor himself the spoils of that:1,0
adventure were a few things items armor:1,0
special daggers etc but what he also:1,0
came back with were his two children:1,0
oddly enough Nico's a family who was:1,0
wiped out has now been replaced by these:1,0
two newly made orphans who decided to:1,0
cooperate he rolled some very high:1,0
comfort checks some super high calm and:1,0
so they they lovingly accepted your your:1,0
guardianship you can see them right here:1,0
we have two of them we got this one and:1,0
this one you have a boy the taller one:1,0
right there:1,0
his name is chard and you have the:1,0
shorter one for the boat her name is:1,0
Alana they are about ten probably an:1,0
eleven years old when she heard that's:1,0
it that's a run for it's a rough name I:1,0
can tell you a little bit about chard:1,0
actually now that you've come to know:1,0
and we've traveled back to the home tree:1,0
from the mansion:1,0
um chart is an interesting young boys ax:1,0
is hearty young fellow who despite his:1,0
his kind of built appearance is:1,0
completely oblivious that he's oblivious:1,0
to everything around him he's totally:1,0
down for whatever:1,0
sweet yeah he supposedly till he loves:1,0
bud white he's neither bug boy yeah um:1,0
also you've noticed he's had he has a:1,0
crude tattoo on him that he drew himself:1,0
Charlie sounds like he's gonna turn out:1,0
just fine yeah so he's a very easy very:1,0
general eat him yeah that's what happens:1,0
when you the son of a mayor and taken by:1,0
barbarians he's all mixed up and then:1,0
also you have a lot of a little bit:1,0
about her she's got a really funny:1,0
looking nose that's the first thing:1,0
everything's everyone sees but uh but:1,0
just like her brother she's kind of:1,0
built you know she's stocky she's not:1,0
oblivious like a Chartist but she's:1,0
pretty done um however she happens to be:1,0
an amazing painter and she is brutally:1,0
honest you also released two:1,0
kobolds prisoners from the mayor's house:1,0
and they are absolutely loyal servants:1,0
because you freed them and you can see:1,0
them down there they all they got on:1,0
them are just their little packs and:1,0
pickaxes but they are literally willing:1,0
to do anything you say can they speak:1,0
common no base bake they just click and:1,0
spit and they gnashed their teeth about:1,0
a week's worth of time has passed so far:1,0
you've all read at Nico's home tree and:1,0
what is yep we all knew everyone knows:1,0
where it is every time you're really:1,0
surprised to see the first day yeah:1,0
everyone was very surprised:1,0
yeah um and along with you guys you'll:1,0
find brand your your wife and stunt son:1,0
Matilda and Steve yeah little Steve:1,0
Steve was captured by some of the people:1,0
and turned into a slave briefly and:1,0
because of that he's gonna he hit he has:1,0
acquired an unusual skin color probably:1,0
from some sort of beating or whatever:1,0
town maybe he's maybe he's just not he:1,0
needs more nutrients or something who:1,0
knows only his skin changed colors yeah:1,0
maybe because it was the stress he's:1,0
starting to bald a little bit he's a:1,0
balding little 12 year old yeah but you:1,0
but he's exceptionally wise rosacea and:1,0
from the events that he's done yeah and:1,0
just let me know a little bit about what:1,0
you guys have done over this last week:1,0
while you're kind of healing up kind of:1,0
like you know recuperating from these:1,0
horrific events that have happened to:1,0
you what's very and done after the:1,0
incident I came back with them obviously:1,0
because my wife Mara was in no keys:1,0
weird home free so yeah we're trying to:1,0
figure out what our next move is because:1,0
I don't think things are gonna stay calm:1,0
for long yeah exactly:1,0
and now Neko or sorry no key think about:1,0
the experiences we had really our:1,0
general of raising our meal replacement:1,0
yep um I have been doing meticulous:1,0
recon on the settlements below that have:1,0
been forming I spent all the way up to:1,0
the coast turning into a fish in:1,0
particular swimming down the river fish:1,0
recon you've been doing fish recon wait:1,0
so like you are just a fish and you just:1,0
pick your little fish head out of the:1,0
water like look at what's happening a:1,0
favorite thing to do is to run to this:1,0
bridge jump off like just like you know:1,0
go full spread eagle and then turn to a:1,0
fish and like hit the water as ready:1,0
eagle yes I don't think that's what they:1,0
least spread eagle for then phrase yeah:1,0
it something like this where the fish:1,0
takes its when spread eagle means but:1,0
okay no a fish when a fish takes its:1,0
fins that goes pretty whole he's like:1,0
yeah have any goals ready go man I:1,0
thought about I've done this a lot:1,0
that's what any more thing to do:1,0
like a whole world that's if everything:1,0
to do right now I get trying to I think:1,0
it's saying my family's dead people more:1,0
so yeah you're good your eyes it a:1,0
little bit okay how how are the how are:1,0
you dealing with the kids how the kids:1,0
ah the new kids they're probably the new:1,0
kids they seem like they're pretty cool:1,0
the pretty chill well they seem okay:1,0
yeah you surprise me they don't really:1,0
seem that upset about what happened to:1,0
their pops I don't know oh they don't:1,0
know what happened right just kidding in:1,0
talking to them you you you find that:1,0
they are very eager to join you guys on:1,0
their on your adventures because they've:1,0
led a very sheltered life and they:1,0
really they really want to they want to:1,0
get out there I'm gonna hit the streets:1,0
pop Sedona hit the street pop said to go:1,0
to business trip yeah pops business hey:1,0
Ron this is Jerry Yellin across the:1,0
Sierra doc yeah so so going back to:1,0
Nicko's fish recon as he swims down the:1,0
stream that leads from the top of the:1,0
mountains down to the the coast he has:1,0
found out that there are there is a:1,0
small settlement along the way that has:1,0
since been evacuated:1,0
it looks like they're withdrawing a:1,0
little bit well here's the thing you're:1,0
a fish you're swimming downstream here's:1,0
the pure fish I want to see how far you:1,0
went so what do you think would:1,0
determine that acrobatics fish wisdom I:1,0
think that's all for me a fish wisdom:1,0
check because if you go too far you:1,0
might get snapper 16 plus lubbers you:1,0
got pretty far:1,0
you got pretty far than us so ooh his:1,0
fish wisdom was allowed him to get far:1,0
enough downstream to even see the fact:1,0
that they're kind of reforming how they:1,0
operate they're reforming your:1,0
government you don't recognize some of:1,0
the same colors and everything from what:1,0
you saw previously:1,0
hmm I would like to end the bloodshed if:1,0
possible I don't think they'll allow us:1,0
to do that after what we did after we:1,0
left so many innocents:1,0
and witnesses during half tax Tuesdays I:1,0
wonder if that word has spread their:1,0
cutbacks Tuesday we might not get very:1,0
far:1,0
it didn't go very far it didn't get very:1,0
far you told everyone those half tax:1,0
Tuesday and then they all fled for their:1,0
lives back to the town and then that was:1,0
the end of the last half tax to this so:1,0
that being said you are back up the home:1,0
tree what you are also finding is that:1,0
other tribes other people in the area:1,0
are becoming interested in your cause:1,0
yeah I:1,0
during my Scouts I've noticed that there:1,0
are watching parties that are inching:1,0
closer what do we eat most one else gold:1,0
stone or trees what do we have most we:1,0
eat Muslim wife for you we need a wife:1,0
for you so it's not so awkward when we:1,0
go on dates is it man:1,0
by the way are these two people actually:1,0
standing here or should they not be here:1,0
oh they're standing there yeah they just:1,0
arrived in there wait I got the other:1,0
you guys to sort your stuff out before:1,0
introducing themselves:1,0
oh is this a druid right here just as no:1,0
key points over it's like it's not a:1,0
druid there yeah the druid speaks up and:1,0
you notice there is a druid and some:1,0
sort of protector she she has by her:1,0
side the the female druid speaks and she:1,0
says greetings villagers my my name is:1,0
Linnell I'm a Drude from the hips and I:1,0
wish Yogi's ribs I wish to --have you:1,0
knew your colors perhaps there might be:1,0
a peaceful solution to this and I'd like:1,0
you to consider that before the entire:1,0
section of land that we are reside in is:1,0
surrounded and enveloped by chaos I'm:1,0
gonna do a perception check to size her:1,0
up kind of see just get a good idea of:1,0
who she is no match for No:1,0
I rolled them one I'll rope clip from:1,0
check I roll the 20 what do I know about:1,0
it I just look at her like you guys can:1,0
tell she follows the same ways that you:1,0
guys the same way of life she speaks:1,0
from the same voice that you guys:1,0
originated with like so she's judge:1,0
tense barbarians like chill and:1,0
just as she begins finishing you see two:1,0
other people begin walking through the:1,0
woods towards the home tree one wearing:1,0
long black robes and another in black:1,0
clothing walks through and finds you at:1,0
the home tree they stare at everybody:1,0
you can tell that one is a powerful:1,0
warlock and the other one is a a nighty:1,0
maybe it's some sort of servant of his:1,0
and he sits there reception check on:1,0
them all right this time I won't fail:1,0
10:00 perception they look angry they:0,0
look real angry because they walk up:0,0
through the real dangerous they look:0,0
dangerous and they say we seek the:0,0
Slayers that have taken down the:0,0
peasants and then basically they flash:0,0
their roads and you can see that they:0,0
have like small pendants on them so:0,0
they're into flare and stuff they're:0,0
totally in the flare they look like they:0,0
work at TGI Fridays yeah:0,0
TGI Friday exact we can pencil things AI:0,0
Friday CJ CJ ing tjs Fridays they've got:0,0
little pendants and symbols on them that:0,0
kind of look like this and the one in:0,0
the cloak takes his pendant and he holds:0,0
it up and they say do you know what this:0,0
symbol means do you do a history check:0,0
to see if I know what's going down:0,0
Oh then a 20 dude you just remembered:0,0
all of his answers for sister tripping:0,0
all right that's symbol these people:0,0
they they are followers of the god hex:0,0
tour in in this situation you find:0,0
yourselves having a lot in common with:0,0
the followers Axl heck's tour embodies:0,0
chaos slaughter battle they relish in:0,0
this this is their jam so followers a:0,0
text or it's like how did you know or in:0,0
with that he takes his pendant covers:0,0
his cloak over it and he says we would:0,0
like to make a proposal we asked for you:0,0
to continue this battle for vengeance:0,0
because we would like to join it with:1,0
you we hate so dearly these forces that:1,0
have been crushing on the land and we:1,0
want to be by your side when you take:1,0
the last of them out will you let us:1,0
join you or perhaps you would like to:1,0
join us:1,0
I'm not here to start a war we were just:1,0
out for vengeance and we had to get:1,0
Brandon's wife back we'll some afternoon:1,0
vengeance I don't think we're gonna be:1,0
safe until the sellers leave our land:1,0
but the Warlock looks directly at the:1,0
area we've passed through the fields:1,0
we've seen the bodies in the blood that:1,0
you have left behind no man that has:1,0
done that is not asking for a war what:1,0
we started we know will not end here and:1,0
with that one more visitor comes to join:1,0
the circles:1,0
oh no way too easy I can grip on the is:1,0
it the grandpa he lands next to the:1,0
carriage this bird and he starts picking:1,0
up a ground you dig worms you know:1,0
there's Kazumi met him before and the:1,0
bird finishes eating his warm he looks:1,0
to everyone and without even a single:1,0
word you hear in your mind's it's me the:1,0
village elder:1,0
you remember what I when I died its I:1,0
took a bird form right hmm so long you:1,0
guys my god I've come to you to tell you:1,0
a message to be wary of both of these:1,0
decisions with that I must tell you even:1,0
worse news:0,0
these soldiers in the town has heard of:0,0
your deeds and it's coming to kill you:0,0
and they're sending many men I do not:0,0
know how many but many of them are:0,0
coming from the city right now and I can:0,0
only tell you that you must act at once:0,0
how far how much time do we have:0,0
it looks like they are probably about:0,0
five to six miles away and if you could:0,0
make it in time you can meet them:0,0
without aid we need to leave you will:0,0
surely perish we need to leave right now:0,0
and maybe see which one these dudes are:0,0
gonna come with us so I snap out of it:0,0
and look up in the bird flaps its wings:0,0
and the druid looks to the burden it's:0,0
like I got food roots like is that it is:0,0
that a spirit animal and the hex door:0,0
people are just like they totally ignore:0,0
it my animal companions have spoken to:0,0
me and just inform me that there's an:0,0
army moving on:0,0
right now you guys wish to join up or:0,0
have us join you demonstrate your value:0,0
we leave immediately:0,0
just as the hex door person is about to:0,0
open their mouth the druid says no wait:0,0
don't don't work with them work with us:0,0
instead we can help you and the hex or:0,0
the hex or priest is like immediately:0,0
shuts her up it's like no our way is the:0,0
only way we can do it we can ad with:0,0
your cos we can help you summon the:0,0
creatures you need and immediately after:0,0
that the Drude comes back just like no:0,0
but the basis of the wild can help us we:0,0
don't need to summon them you just need:0,0
to find them then nokey walks over to:0,0
the druid s and says as you heard an:0,0
army marches on our position right now:0,0
if you wish us to listen to you come:0,0
demonstrate your value and your worth:0,0
there's some familiarity is the these:0,0
are our neighbors these are our:0,0
neighbors you're going to trust these:0,0
these followers of slaughter and chaos:0,0
they want nothing but blood and:0,0
destruction and you're you're going to:0,0
eight have them aid us is that who you:0,0
want us to become you know I didn't:0,0
expect this from you an army is marching:0,0
towards your wife right now and you're:0,0
sitting here arguing with me about:0,0
whether or not you want these guys to:0,0
fight with us to kill that army I'm not:0,0
going to fight an army right now:0,0
what do you are you going I have look:0,0
how many arrows I have how am I supposed:0,0
to fight an army I'm not gonna put my:0,0
wife in danger for this there are other:0,0
ways to find army than by killing all of:0,0
them think of what you're doing here:0,0
think of what we're doing we started:0,0
this with the started pretty simply and:0,0
now it's getting out of hand it's:0,0
getting it very out of him is getting:0,0
out of hand the moment main epochs:0,0
popped up nope you know what really got:0,0
out of hand Darion what I'm a freaking:0,0
family got murdered I think it's still a:0,0
little mad about it yeah a little bit:0,0
that's only a week I don't expect you to:0,0
get over that fast that's all I don't I:0,0
don't think we should trust these men:0,0
I recognize that symbol and that symbol:0,0
is alright not why the Druids would ruin:0,0
one her she was like an army what are:0,0
you talking about:0,0
are they coming here now so we've got:0,0
we've got word that the army is about:0,0
five miles away right now coming so take:0,0
that as a truth what would be your plan:0,0
each of the parties what would you plan:0,0
to do to where this census it's:0,0
obviously happening right now the priest:0,0
the hex source begins to speak up and:0,0
suddenly Llanelli the druid interrupts:0,0
them just before you even open his mouth:0,0
and she says like at first I thought:0,0
peace was the right direction but:0,0
survival is far more important:0,0
I will help direct you to large beasts:0,0
of the wild that can aid you in your:0,0
cause beasts that are far mightier than:0,0
you are and you will be able to call on:0,0
their help to help defend yourselves and:0,0
defend your home tree yeah that's my jam:0,0
so again it is also my favorite yeah is:0,0
she cute cuz that from check six:0,0
yeah she's extra hot but you think it's:0,0
probably because of a spin the priests:0,0
of hex tour puts his staff down when he:0,0
says nonsense the power you will gain:0,0
from a lying with us as far greater than:0,0
any animal in the woods the power you'll:0,0
gain will be eternal lasting far longer:0,0
than the land itself you'll help your:0,0
society your tree your children whoever:0,0
these young children nokey cuts them off:0,0
it's like listen there's an army : we:0,0
need specifics hustle it up man after a:0,0
small initiation we will help summon:0,0
creatures creatures that no one has ever:0,0
seen creatures you have never seen you:0,0
know it:0,0
I don't worship any gods but mine and:0,0
I'm really all about the wild beasts and:0,0
this is a druid lady I don't know if:0,0
she's single or not know if I can bring:0,0
it up a conversation smoothly later on:0,0
so sing and we will not aid you if you:0,0
work with them and the points the Druids:0,0
you can choose to follow us and work:0,0
with us and we will aid you I think the:0,0
decisions are made or we will leave and:0,0
reside you to your fate a fate full of:0,0
strife and struggle and something much:0,0
much more difficult than anything you:0,0
would ever face working with us okay you:0,0
guys are citizens of this land as well:0,0
I'm Emma I'm gonna try to persuade here:0,0
with a 20 I beg you to to reconsider and:0,0
work with me and we can work together in:0,0
some way without us you know we can work:0,0
together in this one he doesn't say this:0,0
but I'm asking this what did you roll 17:0,0
and then I had a plus 13 I see:0,0
perhaps we will have this discussion:0,0
another time for a moment:0,0
I considered waiting until you took over:0,0
the city and took over this land waiting:0,0
for a moment to attack you once you've:0,0
found complacency but we respect your:0,0
cause enough to the point where we will:0,0
step away gracefully and let you:0,0
continue on your cause:0,0
and that he whips his cloak in doing and:0,0
just by that just by that little one:0,0
that he rolled you've now employed an:0,0
entire onslaught of their attack dance:0,0
yeah way to go brand good what they want:1,0
to do is they want to create a state of:1,0
warfare heck story is all about chaos:1,0
and warfare and slaughter and if you:1,0
guys were going to take it over and make:1,0
peace or whatever do whatever you want:1,0
they're basically gonna wait until:1,0
everyone stops fighting and then just:1,0
make sure that ball turns insurance:1,0
because that's more their religion and:1,0
their strength and their power only:1,0
relies on the fact that there's constant:1,0
warfare and you want it aside with it I:1,0
didn't want to side with them I was:1,0
trying to trick them into killing:1,0
themselves in this battle as part of our:1,0
master plan this is like yo Jimbo well:1,0
you guys wanna trick them you went you:1,0
don't think you committed far enough to:1,0
getting them to anyway:1,0
look we're doing who doesn't like hey:1,0
right now they're yeah and with that:1,0
she's like this she cast a spell and:1,0
she's seeing:1,0
I can sense there are two beasts nearby:1,0
which will aid you on your task however:1,0
claiming each one as an ally will be a:1,0
task within itself a cave a rock and:1,0
being then lives there he has been:1,0
plagued by someone but I know that if:1,0
you help him he will join your cause:1,0
also another beast a bear of some sort:1,0
late I do not see its true form lives in:1,0
the woods the only way you'll make:1,0
allies with it though:1,0
is by shedding your arms and armor and:1,0
proving that one of your light is:1,0
stronger than its own well I look over:1,0
our brand sounds of something we can do:1,0
yeah yeah so man brand I'm glad you're:1,0
on the team yeah one the one in the:1,0
forest requires a show of dominance and:1,0
force and the other one requires your:1,0
aid something to rid of its curse I like:1,0
reading curses mobility mode let's hit:1,0
both there's time to do both all right:1,0
which way he gets to this cake it tastes:1,0
and she points her hand and she says:1,0
it's one and a half miles that way she:1,0
points towards this general direction:1,0
button just that she does that:1,0
Chardin Alanna they pipe up and they're:1,0
like where are you going we don't leave:1,0
us here if you're gonna leave we want to:1,0
help and the lizards are like and:1,0
they're like they wave their axes it:1,0
looks like they're like ready they go:1,0
help should bring him along:1,0
take the loser bring the lizards the:1,0
lizards are chill they it's your collar:1,0
kind of key Nokia is your family's so he:1,0
taking whether you want:1,0
listen charges Lana told us we had:1,0
ventures but you guys aren't high enough:1,0
level yet you got trained you got:1,0
trained your butts off so here's what's:1,0
gonna happen today if you train really:1,0
hard he going in the venture tomorrow:1,0
all right:1,0
no he's a good parent he's a good:1,0
supplier a big fight my kids were in:1,0
such great shape before they got:1,0
murdered I might be something if there's:1,0
a big fight and you lose then what:1,0
happens to us want to help you in the:1,0
big fight then maybe I like Daring's:1,0
like why for brands family can like and:1,0
Alana's likes I want to shoot people:1,0
with my bow I never done that before:1,0
sounds like a good opportunity might be:1,0
your chance the next couple days we got:1,0
trying too hard today before I'll to do:1,0
that don't worry Mira will take care of:1,0
you:1,0
she also hasn't great to be intuitive:1,0
yeah something happens to us then she'll:1,0
be there to take care and Steve perhaps:1,0
I'll just play with the other children:1,0
while you guys fight good luck father I:1,0
see you know how big the army is of:1,0
course hunt but you can never have too:1,0
many allies in a great battle after all:1,0
I'm exceptionally wise for a child he:1,0
squints any Ponder's and he does all:1,0
those other absurd personality traits he:1,0
says all right children let's go look:1,0
