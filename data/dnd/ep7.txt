tonight we continue the call of the wild:calm
Dungeons & Dragons campaign if you're:calm
new to this campaign don't worry because:calm
I'm about to explain everything that:calm
just happened where we last left off a:calm
small village comprised of brand:calm
nokey and Darien have had their village:calm
attacked by a invading Society they've:calm
decided in vengeance to take back the:calm
land that is rightfully theirs:calm
slaughtering farmhouses:calm
civilians and even going so far as to:calm
killing the mayor of the very land in:calm
which they reside tonight they must:calm
decide what to do with an enraged:calm
society that wants vengeance against:calm
them now they must confront the allies:calm
that reside in the woods nearby who all:calm
want to take part in their fight so:calm
really quick before we even begin just:calm
as a heads up that little caged in area:calm
right there treat that is something:calm
that's separate and distant from:calm
everything else you see on the map:calm
because that is the home tree the big:calm
old tree right there that's Nico's home:calm
tree okay nice tree man so dude it took:calm
me a long time to grow it yeah where we:calm
last left off was you guys raided the:calm
mayor's house during a private event:calm
Ernest you busted and slaughtered a:calm
bunch of guards and slaughtered the:calm
mayor himself the spoils of that:calm
adventure were a few things items armor:calm
special daggers etc but what he also:calm
came back with were his two children:calm
oddly enough Nico's a family who was:calm
wiped out has now been replaced by these:calm
two newly made orphans who decided to:calm
cooperate he rolled some very high:calm
comfort checks some super high calm and:calm
so they they lovingly accepted your your:calm
guardianship you can see them right here:calm
we have two of them we got this one and:calm
this one you have a boy the taller one:calm
right there:calm
his name is chard and you have the:calm
shorter one for the boat her name is:calm
Alana they are about ten probably an:calm
eleven years old when she heard that's:calm
it that's a run for it's a rough name I:calm
can tell you a little bit about chard:calm
actually now that you've come to know:calm
and we've traveled back to the home tree:calm
from the mansion:calm
um chart is an interesting young boys ax:calm
is hearty young fellow who despite his:calm
his kind of built appearance is:calm
completely oblivious that he's oblivious:calm
to everything around him he's totally:calm
down for whatever:calm
sweet yeah he supposedly till he loves:calm
bud white he's neither bug boy yeah um:calm
also you've noticed he's had he has a:calm
crude tattoo on him that he drew himself:calm
Charlie sounds like he's gonna turn out:calm
just fine yeah so he's a very easy very:calm
general eat him yeah that's what happens:calm
when you the son of a mayor and taken by:calm
barbarians he's all mixed up and then:calm
also you have a lot of a little bit:calm
about her she's got a really funny:calm
looking nose that's the first thing:calm
everything's everyone sees but uh but:calm
just like her brother she's kind of:calm
built you know she's stocky she's not:calm
oblivious like a Chartist but she's:calm
pretty done um however she happens to be:calm
an amazing painter and she is brutally:calm
honest you also released two:calm
kobolds prisoners from the mayor's house:calm
and they are absolutely loyal servants:calm
because you freed them and you can see:calm
them down there they all they got on:calm
them are just their little packs and:calm
pickaxes but they are literally willing:calm
to do anything you say can they speak:calm
common no base bake they just click and:calm
spit and they gnashed their teeth about:calm
a week's worth of time has passed so far:calm
you've all read at Nico's home tree and:calm
what is yep we all knew everyone knows:calm
where it is every time you're really:calm
surprised to see the first day yeah:calm
everyone was very surprised:calm
yeah um and along with you guys you'll:calm
find brand your your wife and stunt son:calm
Matilda and Steve yeah little Steve:calm
Steve was captured by some of the people:calm
and turned into a slave briefly and:calm
because of that he's gonna he hit he has:calm
acquired an unusual skin color probably:calm
from some sort of beating or whatever:calm
town maybe he's maybe he's just not he:calm
needs more nutrients or something who:calm
knows only his skin changed colors yeah:calm
maybe because it was the stress he's:calm
starting to bald a little bit he's a:calm
balding little 12 year old yeah but you:calm
but he's exceptionally wise rosacea and:calm
from the events that he's done yeah and:calm
just let me know a little bit about what:calm
you guys have done over this last week:calm
while you're kind of healing up kind of:calm
like you know recuperating from these:calm
horrific events that have happened to:calm
you what's very and done after the:calm
incident I came back with them obviously:calm
because my wife Mara was in no keys:calm
weird home free so yeah we're trying to:calm
figure out what our next move is because:calm
I don't think things are gonna stay calm:calm
for long yeah exactly:calm
and now Neko or sorry no key think about:calm
the experiences we had really our:calm
general of raising our meal replacement:calm
yep um I have been doing meticulous:calm
recon on the settlements below that have:calm
been forming I spent all the way up to:calm
the coast turning into a fish in:calm
particular swimming down the river fish:calm
recon you've been doing fish recon wait:calm
so like you are just a fish and you just:calm
pick your little fish head out of the:calm
water like look at what's happening a:calm
favorite thing to do is to run to this:calm
bridge jump off like just like you know:calm
go full spread eagle and then turn to a:calm
fish and like hit the water as ready:calm
eagle yes I don't think that's what they:calm
least spread eagle for then phrase yeah:calm
it something like this where the fish:calm
takes its when spread eagle means but:calm
okay no a fish when a fish takes its:calm
fins that goes pretty whole he's like:calm
yeah have any goals ready go man I:calm
thought about I've done this a lot:calm
that's what any more thing to do:calm
like a whole world that's if everything:calm
to do right now I get trying to I think:calm
it's saying my family's dead people more:calm
so yeah you're good your eyes it a:calm
little bit okay how how are the how are:calm
you dealing with the kids how the kids:calm
ah the new kids they're probably the new:calm
kids they seem like they're pretty cool:calm
the pretty chill well they seem okay:calm
yeah you surprise me they don't really:calm
seem that upset about what happened to:calm
their pops I don't know oh they don't:calm
know what happened right just kidding in:calm
talking to them you you you find that:calm
they are very eager to join you guys on:calm
their on your adventures because they've:calm
led a very sheltered life and they:calm
really they really want to they want to:calm
get out there I'm gonna hit the streets:calm
pop Sedona hit the street pop said to go:calm
to business trip yeah pops business hey:calm
Ron this is Jerry Yellin across the:calm
Sierra doc yeah so so going back to:calm
Nicko's fish recon as he swims down the:calm
stream that leads from the top of the:calm
mountains down to the the coast he has:calm
found out that there are there is a:calm
small settlement along the way that has:calm
since been evacuated:calm
it looks like they're withdrawing a:calm
little bit well here's the thing you're:calm
a fish you're swimming downstream here's:calm
the pure fish I want to see how far you:calm
went so what do you think would:calm
determine that acrobatics fish wisdom I:calm
think that's all for me a fish wisdom:calm
check because if you go too far you:calm
might get snapper 16 plus lubbers you:calm
got pretty far:calm
you got pretty far than us so ooh his:calm
fish wisdom was allowed him to get far:calm
enough downstream to even see the fact:calm
that they're kind of reforming how they:calm
operate they're reforming your:calm
government you don't recognize some of:calm
the same colors and everything from what:calm
you saw previously:calm
hmm I would like to end the bloodshed if:calm
possible I don't think they'll allow us:calm
to do that after what we did after we:calm
left so many innocents:calm
and witnesses during half tax Tuesdays I:calm
wonder if that word has spread their:calm
cutbacks Tuesday we might not get very:calm
far:calm
it didn't go very far it didn't get very:calm
far you told everyone those half tax:calm
Tuesday and then they all fled for their:calm
lives back to the town and then that was:calm
the end of the last half tax to this so:calm
that being said you are back up the home:calm
tree what you are also finding is that:calm
other tribes other people in the area:calm
are becoming interested in your cause:calm
yeah I:calm
during my Scouts I've noticed that there:calm
are watching parties that are inching:calm
closer what do we eat most one else gold:calm
stone or trees what do we have most we:calm
eat Muslim wife for you we need a wife:calm
for you so it's not so awkward when we:calm
go on dates is it man:calm
by the way are these two people actually:calm
standing here or should they not be here:calm
oh they're standing there yeah they just:calm
arrived in there wait I got the other:calm
you guys to sort your stuff out before:calm
introducing themselves:calm
oh is this a druid right here just as no:calm
key points over it's like it's not a:calm
druid there yeah the druid speaks up and:calm
you notice there is a druid and some:calm
sort of protector she she has by her:calm
side the the female druid speaks and she:calm
says greetings villagers my my name is:calm
Linnell I'm a Drude from the hips and I:calm
wish Yogi's ribs I wish to --have you:calm
knew your colors perhaps there might be:calm
a peaceful solution to this and I'd like:calm
you to consider that before the entire:calm
section of land that we are reside in is:calm
surrounded and enveloped by chaos I'm:calm
gonna do a perception check to size her:calm
up kind of see just get a good idea of:calm
who she is no match for No:calm
I rolled them one I'll rope clip from:calm
check I roll the 20 what do I know about:calm
it I just look at her like you guys can:calm
tell she follows the same ways that you:calm
guys the same way of life she speaks:calm
from the same voice that you guys:calm
originated with like so she's judge:calm
tense barbarians like chill and:calm
just as she begins finishing you see two:calm
other people begin walking through the:calm
woods towards the home tree one wearing:calm
long black robes and another in black:calm
clothing walks through and finds you at:calm
the home tree they stare at everybody:calm
you can tell that one is a powerful:calm
warlock and the other one is a a nighty:calm
maybe it's some sort of servant of his:calm
and he sits there reception check on:calm
them all right this time I won't fail:calm
10:00 perception they look angry they:suspense
look real angry because they walk up:suspense
through the real dangerous they look:suspense
dangerous and they say we seek the:suspense
Slayers that have taken down the:suspense
peasants and then basically they flash:suspense
their roads and you can see that they:suspense
have like small pendants on them so:suspense
they're into flare and stuff they're:suspense
totally in the flare they look like they:suspense
work at TGI Fridays yeah:suspense
TGI Friday exact we can pencil things AI:suspense
Friday CJ CJ ing tjs Fridays they've got:suspense
little pendants and symbols on them that:suspense
kind of look like this and the one in:suspense
the cloak takes his pendant and he holds:suspense
it up and they say do you know what this:suspense
symbol means do you do a history check:suspense
to see if I know what's going down:suspense
Oh then a 20 dude you just remembered:suspense
all of his answers for sister tripping:suspense
all right that's symbol these people:suspense
they they are followers of the god hex:suspense
tour in in this situation you find:suspense
yourselves having a lot in common with:suspense
the followers Axl heck's tour embodies:suspense
chaos slaughter battle they relish in:suspense
this this is their jam so followers a:suspense
text or it's like how did you know or in:suspense
with that he takes his pendant covers:suspense
his cloak over it and he says we would:suspense
like to make a proposal we asked for you:suspense
to continue this battle for vengeance:suspense
because we would like to join it with:calm
you we hate so dearly these forces that:calm
have been crushing on the land and we:calm
want to be by your side when you take:calm
the last of them out will you let us:calm
join you or perhaps you would like to:calm
join us:calm
I'm not here to start a war we were just:calm
out for vengeance and we had to get:calm
Brandon's wife back we'll some afternoon:calm
vengeance I don't think we're gonna be:calm
safe until the sellers leave our land:calm
but the Warlock looks directly at the:calm
area we've passed through the fields:calm
we've seen the bodies in the blood that:calm
you have left behind no man that has:calm
done that is not asking for a war what:calm
we started we know will not end here and:calm
with that one more visitor comes to join:calm
the circles:calm
oh no way too easy I can grip on the is:calm
it the grandpa he lands next to the:calm
carriage this bird and he starts picking:calm
up a ground you dig worms you know:calm
there's Kazumi met him before and the:calm
bird finishes eating his warm he looks:calm
to everyone and without even a single:calm
word you hear in your mind's it's me the:calm
village elder:calm
you remember what I when I died its I:calm
took a bird form right hmm so long you:calm
guys my god I've come to you to tell you:calm
a message to be wary of both of these:calm
decisions with that I must tell you even:calm
worse news:suspense
these soldiers in the town has heard of:suspense
your deeds and it's coming to kill you:suspense
and they're sending many men I do not:suspense
know how many but many of them are:suspense
coming from the city right now and I can:suspense
only tell you that you must act at once:suspense
how far how much time do we have:suspense
it looks like they are probably about:suspense
five to six miles away and if you could:suspense
make it in time you can meet them:suspense
without aid we need to leave you will:suspense
surely perish we need to leave right now:suspense
and maybe see which one these dudes are:suspense
gonna come with us so I snap out of it:suspense
and look up in the bird flaps its wings:suspense
and the druid looks to the burden it's:suspense
like I got food roots like is that it is:suspense
that a spirit animal and the hex door:suspense
people are just like they totally ignore:suspense
it my animal companions have spoken to:suspense
me and just inform me that there's an:suspense
army moving on:suspense
right now you guys wish to join up or:suspense
have us join you demonstrate your value:suspense
we leave immediately:suspense
just as the hex door person is about to:suspense
open their mouth the druid says no wait:suspense
don't don't work with them work with us:suspense
instead we can help you and the hex or:suspense
the hex or priest is like immediately:suspense
shuts her up it's like no our way is the:suspense
only way we can do it we can ad with:suspense
your cos we can help you summon the:suspense
creatures you need and immediately after:suspense
that the Drude comes back just like no:suspense
but the basis of the wild can help us we:suspense
don't need to summon them you just need:suspense
to find them then nokey walks over to:suspense
the druid s and says as you heard an:suspense
army marches on our position right now:suspense
if you wish us to listen to you come:suspense
demonstrate your value and your worth:suspense
there's some familiarity is the these:suspense
are our neighbors these are our:suspense
neighbors you're going to trust these:suspense
these followers of slaughter and chaos:suspense
they want nothing but blood and:suspense
destruction and you're you're going to:suspense
eight have them aid us is that who you:suspense
want us to become you know I didn't:suspense
expect this from you an army is marching:suspense
towards your wife right now and you're:suspense
sitting here arguing with me about:suspense
whether or not you want these guys to:suspense
fight with us to kill that army I'm not:suspense
going to fight an army right now:suspense
what do you are you going I have look:suspense
how many arrows I have how am I supposed:suspense
to fight an army I'm not gonna put my:suspense
wife in danger for this there are other:suspense
ways to find army than by killing all of:suspense
them think of what you're doing here:suspense
think of what we're doing we started:suspense
this with the started pretty simply and:suspense
now it's getting out of hand it's:suspense
getting it very out of him is getting:suspense
out of hand the moment main epochs:suspense
popped up nope you know what really got:suspense
out of hand Darion what I'm a freaking:suspense
family got murdered I think it's still a:suspense
little mad about it yeah a little bit:suspense
that's only a week I don't expect you to:suspense
get over that fast that's all I don't I:suspense
don't think we should trust these men:suspense
I recognize that symbol and that symbol:suspense
is alright not why the Druids would ruin:suspense
one her she was like an army what are:suspense
you talking about:suspense
are they coming here now so we've got:suspense
we've got word that the army is about:suspense
five miles away right now coming so take:suspense
that as a truth what would be your plan:suspense
each of the parties what would you plan:suspense
to do to where this census it's:suspense
obviously happening right now the priest:suspense
the hex source begins to speak up and:suspense
suddenly Llanelli the druid interrupts:suspense
them just before you even open his mouth:suspense
and she says like at first I thought:suspense
peace was the right direction but:suspense
survival is far more important:suspense
I will help direct you to large beasts:suspense
of the wild that can aid you in your:suspense
cause beasts that are far mightier than:suspense
you are and you will be able to call on:suspense
their help to help defend yourselves and:suspense
defend your home tree yeah that's my jam:suspense
so again it is also my favorite yeah is:suspense
she cute cuz that from check six:suspense
yeah she's extra hot but you think it's:suspense
probably because of a spin the priests:suspense
of hex tour puts his staff down when he:suspense
says nonsense the power you will gain:suspense
from a lying with us as far greater than:suspense
any animal in the woods the power you'll:suspense
gain will be eternal lasting far longer:suspense
than the land itself you'll help your:suspense
society your tree your children whoever:suspense
these young children nokey cuts them off:suspense
it's like listen there's an army : we:suspense
need specifics hustle it up man after a:suspense
small initiation we will help summon:suspense
creatures creatures that no one has ever:suspense
seen creatures you have never seen you:suspense
know it:suspense
I don't worship any gods but mine and:suspense
I'm really all about the wild beasts and:suspense
this is a druid lady I don't know if:suspense
she's single or not know if I can bring:suspense
it up a conversation smoothly later on:suspense
so sing and we will not aid you if you:suspense
work with them and the points the Druids:suspense
you can choose to follow us and work:suspense
with us and we will aid you I think the:suspense
decisions are made or we will leave and:suspense
reside you to your fate a fate full of:suspense
strife and struggle and something much:suspense
much more difficult than anything you:suspense
would ever face working with us okay you:suspense
guys are citizens of this land as well:suspense
I'm Emma I'm gonna try to persuade here:suspense
with a 20 I beg you to to reconsider and:suspense
work with me and we can work together in:suspense
some way without us you know we can work:suspense
together in this one he doesn't say this:suspense
but I'm asking this what did you roll 17:suspense
and then I had a plus 13 I see:suspense
perhaps we will have this discussion:suspense
another time for a moment:suspense
I considered waiting until you took over:suspense
the city and took over this land waiting:suspense
for a moment to attack you once you've:suspense
found complacency but we respect your:suspense
cause enough to the point where we will:suspense
step away gracefully and let you:suspense
continue on your cause:suspense
and that he whips his cloak in doing and:suspense
just by that just by that little one:suspense
that he rolled you've now employed an:suspense
entire onslaught of their attack dance:suspense
yeah way to go brand good what they want:calm
to do is they want to create a state of:calm
warfare heck story is all about chaos:calm
and warfare and slaughter and if you:calm
guys were going to take it over and make:calm
peace or whatever do whatever you want:calm
they're basically gonna wait until:calm
everyone stops fighting and then just:calm
make sure that ball turns insurance:calm
because that's more their religion and:calm
their strength and their power only:calm
relies on the fact that there's constant:calm
warfare and you want it aside with it I:calm
didn't want to side with them I was:calm
trying to trick them into killing:calm
themselves in this battle as part of our:calm
master plan this is like yo Jimbo well:calm
you guys wanna trick them you went you:calm
don't think you committed far enough to:calm
getting them to anyway:calm
look we're doing who doesn't like hey:calm
right now they're yeah and with that:calm
she's like this she cast a spell and:calm
she's seeing:calm
I can sense there are two beasts nearby:calm
which will aid you on your task however:calm
claiming each one as an ally will be a:calm
task within itself a cave a rock and:calm
being then lives there he has been:calm
plagued by someone but I know that if:calm
you help him he will join your cause:calm
also another beast a bear of some sort:calm
late I do not see its true form lives in:calm
the woods the only way you'll make:calm
allies with it though:calm
is by shedding your arms and armor and:calm
proving that one of your light is:calm
stronger than its own well I look over:calm
our brand sounds of something we can do:calm
yeah yeah so man brand I'm glad you're:calm
on the team yeah one the one in the:calm
forest requires a show of dominance and:calm
force and the other one requires your:calm
aid something to rid of its curse I like:calm
reading curses mobility mode let's hit:calm
both there's time to do both all right:calm
which way he gets to this cake it tastes:calm
and she points her hand and she says:calm
it's one and a half miles that way she:calm
points towards this general direction:calm
button just that she does that:calm
Chardin Alanna they pipe up and they're:calm
like where are you going we don't leave:calm
us here if you're gonna leave we want to:calm
help and the lizards are like and:calm
they're like they wave their axes it:calm
looks like they're like ready they go:calm
help should bring him along:calm
take the loser bring the lizards the:calm
lizards are chill they it's your collar:calm
kind of key Nokia is your family's so he:calm
taking whether you want:calm
listen charges Lana told us we had:calm
ventures but you guys aren't high enough:calm
level yet you got trained you got:calm
trained your butts off so here's what's:calm
gonna happen today if you train really:calm
hard he going in the venture tomorrow:calm
all right:calm
no he's a good parent he's a good:calm
supplier a big fight my kids were in:calm
such great shape before they got:calm
murdered I might be something if there's:calm
a big fight and you lose then what:calm
happens to us want to help you in the:calm
big fight then maybe I like Daring's:calm
like why for brands family can like and:calm
Alana's likes I want to shoot people:calm
with my bow I never done that before:calm
sounds like a good opportunity might be:calm
your chance the next couple days we got:calm
trying too hard today before I'll to do:calm
that don't worry Mira will take care of:calm
you:calm
she also hasn't great to be intuitive:calm
yeah something happens to us then she'll:calm
be there to take care and Steve perhaps:calm
I'll just play with the other children:calm
while you guys fight good luck father I:calm
see you know how big the army is of:calm
course hunt but you can never have too:calm
many allies in a great battle after all:calm
I'm exceptionally wise for a child he:calm
squints any Ponder's and he does all:calm
those other absurd personality traits he:calm
says all right children let's go look:calm
for pinecones children Char Char de:calm
llano just go along with them they're:calm
like this kids so dumb and boring if you:calm
got put them next to the home tree just:calm
keep them there up in there:calm
uh-huh your wife's gonna stay there my:calm
wife's gonna stay here we're gonna bring:calm
the little little guys along we're gonna:calm
name them uh take and tak that's all:calm
right that's not bad:calm
yeah I like the two you good you go with:calm
tick attack all right take is the cute:calm
one and tack is the handsome one okay:calm
all right kick some mysteries yeah keep:calm
it straight don't mess it up okay and:calm
the the druid Linnell she says I will:calm
not join you but what I will do instead:calm
is I will cast a powerful spell over the:calm
home tree in the surrounding area that:calm
should help ward anyone who comes this:calm
way thank you is that a deal and in with:calm
that I will send my servant to aid you:calm
okay cool that's great thank you okay:calm
then she goes over there she waves her:calm
wand around and she could you see this:calm
like a little magical chromatic:calm
aberration displacement map kind of like:calm
dome form around it throws it like that:calm
was like Sheila grenades is me yeah it's:calm
like hail hexagon just like it was like:calm
master shapes like yeah exactly and I:calm
just casually mentioned when she can:calm
hear it but you know what it wasn't for:calm
no Keys heroics - it was no chance to:calm
prevail before and she looks over at no:calm
key and she was like said like thanks a:calm
lot for help really nice Edie so I'm:calm
only doing it because of the land which:calm
I vowed to protect that's pretty cool:calm
I've got particular in - she talked:calm
about some time not now cuz I have to go:calm
fight some bad guys I'll see you later:calm
nice all right we're gonna head out:calm
let's do it and so with that decision:calm
your party marches out from the camp:calm
with a very strong determination to find:calm
allies to help you in what seems like a:calm
hopeless battle:calm
