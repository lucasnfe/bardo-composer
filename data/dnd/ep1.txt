hello everybody and welcome to a night:calm
of LAN party Dungeons & Dragons tonight:calm
I will be the dungeon master and I will:calm
be running Brandon Nico and Dee through:calm
another epic campaign of mine in this:calm
one these adventurers start as members:calm
of a barbarian tribe a nomadic one that:calm
is scouring the wilderness for survival:calm
when one day well we're gonna find out:calm
so Sam Nico and Dee are veterans of a:calm
D&D:calm
I is my first time playing you're not if:calm
you guys have never played before:calm
because you can learn it through through:calm
my eyes as we do this because I'll be:calm
asking I'll be asking some of the new:calm
questions as we go a lot so so let's:calm
just get a quick look at what you guys:calm
are facing here this is your camp all:calm
right and as you can see there's some:calm
sort of civilization encroaching into:calm
your your peaceful wilderness how tall:calm
are those mountains:calm
ah it doesn't matter it doesn't matter:calm
there are large Hills so guys what's the:calm
name of your tribe ah team huddle we are:calm
I mean we're cool dudes for cool dudes:calm
we we don't like we don't like streets:calm
there's a rubber hands why do we need a:calm
name we're just the tribe the tribe with:calm
no name actually you're right the tribe:calm
the day begins like any other day you:calm
guys are all huddled around a warm:calm
campfire together with your families and:calm
yourselves as one tribe we have a couple:calm
characters here we have one character:calm
over here this is the town elder his:calm
name is Bartholomew is it's not the most:calm
barbarian name but he is a wise old man:calm
who has has helped you and your tribe:calm
for years and years and years as you can:calm
see there's a few other people around:calm
campfire as well and that's your:calm
families so Brandon I would like you to:calm
introduce yourself and your wife and:calm
your son to everybody my name is bran:calm
short for Brandon a brand I'm a barber:calm
barbarian obviously strong driven man:calm
yeah you know with with its sights on:calm
the future and he is also well liked by:calm
the tribe and specifically the tribe:calm
elder yeah he's got a crush on you're:calm
pretty much like the tribe champion:calm
you're the trying it here's the t's:calm
modest don't let me don't let us - t for:calm
you Brennan right Brandon is the tribes:calm
champion you can physically beat up:calm
anyone in the Tri exactly mm-hmm so that:calm
makes him the champion here's I married:calm
I had a child but what's what's your:calm
name what's your name her name is:calm
Matilda Matilda and what's your uh what:calm
is that I think you have a son there:calm
what's his name his name uh Steve:calm
Oh Steve my personality rate is that I:calm
miss function long words it sound:calm
smarter mmm my ideals as I've got a:calm
destiny that uh nothing can really steer:calm
me away from his higher calling like I:calm
am I'm destined to lead this tribe to:calm
success and beat the champion the hero:calm
the people:calm
that's great uh and flaunt convinced so:calm
much by such an undying faith in my:calm
destiny but I ignore my shortcomings in:calm
my failures along the way my character:calm
he is a human ranger his name is daryun:calm
no he is a hunter he hunts and kills:calm
animals for the tribe and he is really:calm
good Archer so pretty valuable I'd say:calm
to a small tribe like this I have one:calm
wife and her name is Mira and she was:calm
actually my bond:calm
I love Mira more than anything in this:calm
whole world but I use it but Longo and:calm
too short swords I generally yeah I've:calm
used two short swords on my back till:calm
you cut your hair just so my personality:calm
trait is my character he never relies on:calm
other people he generally just relies:calm
himself to do things and get things done:calm
and my flaw for my character is that I:calm
distrust absolutely anyone I don't know:calm
oh so my character is basically the:calm
druid of the tribe:calm
his name is No:calm
kee Mao and ohk I basically he lives in:calm
a tree more or less but it's like:calm
hollowed out in the bottom there's kind:calm
of been a hut expanded from with the:calm
tree that I live in was planted when I:calm
was a baby and therefore mean that tree:calm
share a bond is the tree out here yes:calm
see this tree which which no that's a:calm
little bit further away from like okay I:calm
found it was this one we tend to pretend:calm
the tree is not right next to that camp:calm
well that's why you've came back to camp:calm
here is because I would never let:calm
something build a campfire that close to:calm
my treat okay well it was probably just:calm
this tree over so protective of its tree:calm
I'm really protective of the street:calm
because that tree is my bond:calm
Nikko it looks like what is this that's:calm
what you have a wife and child as well:calm
Oh as a druid how surprising yeah most:calm
grandson do what cause I know what a:calm
lucky druid wake up yes the name Appetit:calm
see your wife there in the cool like:calm
sideways post like yeah and your child:calm
can see can you see your child a little:calm
it'll a little girl your daughter yeah:calm
what's your wife and daughters name ah:calm
my wife's name is Lily and my daughter's:calm
name is maple whoo named after tree well:calm
millions on a tree it's a flower:calm
yeah I mean I didn't name my wife okay:calm
you're right you didn't get it all right:calm
my deal is that of unspoiled wilderness:calm
and the people living with the land like:calm
a like a classic Native American tribe:calm
and my flaws are that I discriminate:calm
against outsiders you guys are chilling:calm
out at your campfire one day in the end:calm
the petroi builder he's covered in rags:calm
and he's frail his bones are frail and:calm
he walks up to the campfire and he says:calm
today is the day of the hunt you must:calm
feed our tribe with food:calm
to the direct north of here I sensed I:calm
sensed food I sensed an elk perhaps near:calm
perhaps more I feel like it is up to you:calm
to hunt down one of these animals and:calm
bring it up bring it back to this tribe:calm
to feed us all everyone role perception:suspense
checks okay so so what time of day is it:suspense
it's at night 9:00 in the morning start:suspense
2020 oh my role is 16 well then no one:suspense

sorry no key here's something what is:suspense
happening is there is a small karab√ºk:suspense
small wagon the horse-drawn wagon coming:suspense
through the trees and it stops at your:suspense

out of the wagon:suspense
and stands before you he says Oh Hawaii:suspense

economy:suspense
nothing far away I bring gifts I do not:suspense
