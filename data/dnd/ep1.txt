hello everybody and welcome to a night:1,0
of LAN party Dungeons & Dragons tonight:1,0
I will be the dungeon master and I will:1,0
be running Brandon Nico and Dee through:1,0
another epic campaign of mine in this:1,0
one these adventurers start as members:1,0
of a barbarian tribe a nomadic one that:1,0
is scouring the wilderness for survival:1,0
when one day well we're gonna find out:1,0
so Sam Nico and Dee are veterans of a:1,0
D&D:1,0
I is my first time playing you're not if:1,0
you guys have never played before:1,0
because you can learn it through through:1,0
my eyes as we do this because I'll be:1,0
asking I'll be asking some of the new:1,0
questions as we go a lot so so let's:1,0
just get a quick look at what you guys:1,0
are facing here this is your camp all:1,0
right and as you can see there's some:1,0
sort of civilization encroaching into:1,0
your your peaceful wilderness how tall:1,0
are those mountains:1,0
ah it doesn't matter it doesn't matter:1,0
there are large Hills so guys what's the:1,0
name of your tribe ah team huddle we are:1,0
I mean we're cool dudes for cool dudes:1,0
we we don't like we don't like streets:1,0
there's a rubber hands why do we need a:1,0
name we're just the tribe the tribe with:1,0
no name actually you're right the tribe:1,0
the day begins like any other day you:1,0
guys are all huddled around a warm:1,0
campfire together with your families and:1,0
yourselves as one tribe we have a couple:1,0
characters here we have one character:1,0
over here this is the town elder his:1,0
name is Bartholomew is it's not the most:1,0
barbarian name but he is a wise old man:1,0
who has has helped you and your tribe:1,0
for years and years and years as you can:1,0
see there's a few other people around:1,0
campfire as well and that's your:1,0
families so Brandon I would like you to:1,0
introduce yourself and your wife and:1,0
your son to everybody my name is bran:1,0
short for Brandon a brand I'm a barber:1,0
barbarian obviously strong driven man:1,0
yeah you know with with its sights on:1,0
the future and he is also well liked by:1,0
the tribe and specifically the tribe:1,0
elder yeah he's got a crush on you're:1,0
pretty much like the tribe champion:1,0
you're the trying it here's the t's:1,0
modest don't let me don't let us - t for:1,0
you Brennan right Brandon is the tribes:1,0
champion you can physically beat up:1,0
anyone in the Tri exactly mm-hmm so that:1,0
makes him the champion here's I married:1,0
I had a child but what's what's your:1,0
name what's your name her name is:1,0
Matilda Matilda and what's your uh what:1,0
is that I think you have a son there:1,0
what's his name his name uh Steve:1,0
Oh Steve my personality rate is that I:1,0
miss function long words it sound:1,0
smarter mmm my ideals as I've got a:1,0
destiny that uh nothing can really steer:1,0
me away from his higher calling like I:1,0
am I'm destined to lead this tribe to:1,0
success and beat the champion the hero:1,0
the people:1,0
that's great uh and flaunt convinced so:1,0
much by such an undying faith in my:1,0
destiny but I ignore my shortcomings in:1,0
my failures along the way my character:1,0
he is a human ranger his name is daryun:1,0
no he is a hunter he hunts and kills:1,0
animals for the tribe and he is really:1,0
good Archer so pretty valuable I'd say:1,0
to a small tribe like this I have one:1,0
wife and her name is Mira and she was:1,0
actually my bond:1,0
I love Mira more than anything in this:1,0
whole world but I use it but Longo and:1,0
too short swords I generally yeah I've:1,0
used two short swords on my back till:1,0
you cut your hair just so my personality:1,0
trait is my character he never relies on:1,0
other people he generally just relies:1,0
himself to do things and get things done:1,0
and my flaw for my character is that I:1,0
distrust absolutely anyone I don't know:1,0
oh so my character is basically the:1,0
druid of the tribe:1,0
his name is No:1,0
kee Mao and ohk I basically he lives in:1,0
a tree more or less but it's like:1,0
hollowed out in the bottom there's kind:1,0
of been a hut expanded from with the:1,0
tree that I live in was planted when I:1,0
was a baby and therefore mean that tree:1,0
share a bond is the tree out here yes:1,0
see this tree which which no that's a:1,0
little bit further away from like okay I:1,0
found it was this one we tend to pretend:1,0
the tree is not right next to that camp:1,0
well that's why you've came back to camp:1,0
here is because I would never let:1,0
something build a campfire that close to:1,0
my treat okay well it was probably just:1,0
this tree over so protective of its tree:1,0
I'm really protective of the street:1,0
because that tree is my bond:1,0
Nikko it looks like what is this that's:1,0
what you have a wife and child as well:1,0
Oh as a druid how surprising yeah most:1,0
grandson do what cause I know what a:1,0
lucky druid wake up yes the name Appetit:1,0
see your wife there in the cool like:1,0
sideways post like yeah and your child:1,0
can see can you see your child a little:1,0
it'll a little girl your daughter yeah:1,0
what's your wife and daughters name ah:1,0
my wife's name is Lily and my daughter's:1,0
name is maple whoo named after tree well:1,0
millions on a tree it's a flower:1,0
yeah I mean I didn't name my wife okay:1,0
you're right you didn't get it all right:1,0
my deal is that of unspoiled wilderness:1,0
and the people living with the land like:1,0
a like a classic Native American tribe:1,0
and my flaws are that I discriminate:1,0
against outsiders you guys are chilling:1,0
out at your campfire one day in the end:1,0
the petroi builder he's covered in rags:1,0
and he's frail his bones are frail and:1,0
he walks up to the campfire and he says:1,0
today is the day of the hunt you must:1,0
feed our tribe with food:1,0
to the direct north of here I sensed I:1,0
sensed food I sensed an elk perhaps near:1,0
perhaps more I feel like it is up to you:1,0
to hunt down one of these animals and:1,0
bring it up bring it back to this tribe:1,0
to feed us all everyone role perception:0,0
checks okay so so what time of day is it:0,0
it's at night 9:00 in the morning start:0,0
2020 oh my role is 16 well then no one:0,0
else even asked a role because Niko here:0,0
something:0,0
sorry no key here's something what is:0,0
happening is there is a small karab√ºk:0,0
small wagon the horse-drawn wagon coming:0,0
through the trees and it stops at your:0,0
camp and what happens is the driver hops:0,0
out of the wagon:0,0
and stands before you he says Oh Hawaii:0,0
tribesman I come in peace he holds his:0,0
hands up would you move my character so:0,0
he's looking at the card I bring gifts I:0,0
see I see you're worn leathers I see I:0,0
see your low rations I bring gifts:0,0
I see we have a town a burgeoning:0,0
economy:0,0
nothing far away I bring gifts I do not:0,0
want to harm you I only come in peace:0,0
and he immediately starts taking out:0,0
like a fine suit of scale mail and he he:0,0
goes here and he offers this he's like:0,0
please remember this as a token of faith:0,0
from our society to yours are you you:0,0
look strong oh I'm worried we've never:0,0
interacted with you before I'm worried:0,0
they might be bringing some sorry:0,0
disease our way here a gift from me to:0,0
you do with these as you wish 20 steel:0,0
tipped arrows scale nail rations / -:0,0
like however many grains you want to:0,0
take all you want we have a farm nearby:0,0
and with that I bid you farewell and he:0,0
hops on his wagon and he hits his brake:0,0
lights and his reverse is it food and a:0,0
frickin bust attaboy:1,0
starts going back to town so you took:1,0
the scale nail yep I don't take anything:1,0
specific did you tell me that's gonna:1,0
take the arrows so the village elder:1,0
inspects the grains and he says well:1,0
perhaps this will feed us but there's:1,0
honor in the hunt you guys wanna go:1,0
