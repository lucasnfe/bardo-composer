428.49,6.03,found out that there are there is a,1,0
432.06,6.15,small settlement along the way that has,1,0
434.52,5.129,since been evacuated,1,0
438.21,3.329,it looks like they're withdrawing a,1,0
439.649,3.811,little bit well here's the thing you're,1,0
441.539,4.261,a fish you're swimming downstream here's,1,0

447.389,5.941,determine that acrobatics fish wisdom I,1,0
450.629,4.921,think that's all for me a fish wisdom,1,0
453.33,4.739,check because if you go too far you,1,0
455.55,3.419,might get snapper 16 plus lubbers you,1,0

458.969,5.76,you got pretty far than us so ooh his,1,0
462.149,5.13,fish wisdom was allowed him to get far,1,0
464.729,5.49,enough downstream to even see the fact,1,0
467.279,4.021,that they're kind of reforming how they,1,0
470.219,3.78,operate they're reforming your,1,0
471.3,4.5,government you don't recognize some of,1,0
473.999,2.76,the same colors and everything from what,1,0
475.8,3.479,you saw previously,1,0
476.759,4.5,hmm I would like to end the bloodshed if,1,0
479.279,4.35,possible I don't think they'll allow us,1,0
481.259,3.671,to do that after what we did after we,1,0
483.629,4.951,left so many innocents,1,0
484.93,6.15,and witnesses during half tax Tuesdays I,1,0
488.58,4.36,wonder if that word has spread their,1,0
491.08,2.429,cutbacks Tuesday we might not get very,1,0
492.94,1.949,far,1,0
493.509,3.331,it didn't go very far it didn't get very,1,0
494.889,4.051,far you told everyone those half tax,1,0
496.84,3.87,Tuesday and then they all fled for their,1,0
498.94,4.08,lives back to the town and then that was,1,0
500.71,5.16,the end of the last half tax to this so,1,0
