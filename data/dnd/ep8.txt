the first location which you were going:1,0
to visit and try and find allies is a:1,0
small cave that resides on the side of:1,0
the valley with you travel the aid of:1,0
the druid yet-to-be-named since there:1,0
has been no word spoken between you and:1,0
her:1,0
and the newly named tikkun tak who are:1,0
actually just kobold miners walking:1,0
through the woods the trees start to:1,0
part and you see a small rocky:1,0
outcropping on the side of the hill so I:1,0
take it you know our name so what is:1,0
your name and she said not your name:1,0
she's like staring straight at me:1,0
well I mean like in my recognition I:1,0
gotta look over here to talk to her okay:1,0
she says my name is Olga I care to reiax:1,0
I had a feeling your name was all go:1,0
she's pretty Bush but she looks like she:1,0
could get kicks and fucking oh I can:1,0
tell by her voice she kick some ass you:1,0
know do you know anything about this:1,0
beast that we're looking for not at all:1,0
sounds good let's do this we can see:1,0
through the trees little bit here so I'm:0,0
just gonna roll a perception of um yeah:0,0
it's a strange-looking cave never seen:0,0
caves twelve perception looking forward:0,0
to those caves see if we can identify:0,0
where the Beast is or any night then:0,0
what do you see before you is a bunch of:0,0
rocks all piled up you can see a small:0,0
opening in the center and generally a:0,0
small black hole there all right we're:0,0
gonna we're gonna have head up we get up:0,0
to the distance there and just call out:0,0
you know hello there your silence:0,0
you hear the mountain wind blowing:0,0
between the rocks slight whistling based:0,0
on the Lana's words we can probably walk:0,0
up there on the creature like we want to:0,0
kill us:0,0
I suggest we not walk in as an entire:0,0
party is just we approach it with few:0,0
numbers single-file tic-tac Olga you:0,0
guys wait here:0,0
organ sound like ticking by himself no:0,0
you don't want it good I can speak:0,0
English hmm poking that cave there seems:0,0
like your droid abilities may come in:0,0
handy I'm actually kind of move:0,0
stealthily ahead into the cave all right:0,0
19 for stealth plus other things:0,0
all right 19 stealth exits 22 we're only:0,0
perception perception is a solid 14 14:0,0
well you can see what looks like to be:0,0
rocky outcroppings you see a little bit:0,0
of like mossy kind of overgrowth some:0,0
unsent of the rocks right in the center:0,0
here it's a small it's a small black:0,0
hole looks like you have to hunched over:0,0

rumbling within the rocks you hear the:0,1
sound and rock elemental bursts out of:0,1
the rocks goes into the ground and:0,1
burrows itself in only to pop out a few:0,1

points of damage and you see the arrow:0,1
it goes in this is the rock and this is:0,1
the fungus and your arrow goes right in:0,1
between it and goes and scrapes its:0,1
clean off and this piece of fungus:0,1
it flies about this far watch out it's:0,1
angry fungus now you can see that when:0,1
the arrow hits the fungus it it like:0,1
twitches and go like it explodes in like:0,1
anger I have another attack yo then I'm:0,1
going to take another two steps this way:0,1

Cobalts and Olga are standing behind you:0,1
ready to fight and they turn and they:0,1
saige:0,1
should we move in we can help take care:0,1
of the spores and the lizards are like:0,1
they they kind of get what to do:0,1
I think the lizard should hold back:0,1
lizards in fact Olga move in after I:0,1
don't lizards do just chill alright so:0,1
the earth elemental super pissed off now:0,1
C's brand in its path and it takes one:0,1
arm it's still raging swings with up arm:0,1
does a 22 hit 22 it yes and it swings:0,1
with its other arm and 11 doesn't hit:0,1
that's for sure one of the great huge:0,1
arms comes down and hits you and deals:0,1
you 15 points of damage:0,1
okay it's a giant piece of rock just:0,1
slamming into you now it's no Keith:0,1
there take a couple steps backs I'm:0,1
pretty hurt I think my legs broken:0,1
sudden maybe not actually I can move up:0,1
my full speed still apparently 5 10 15:0,1
20 25 I'll just walk her down here by:0,1
the street you are in so far away I'm:0,1
still within six feet of the case:0,1
Coggins tango ah this big five-foot big:0,1
flaming spear lice and fire and then I:0,1
move it and goes sweeping across and:0,1
hits this creature and the other:0,1
creatures that are on this creature:0,1
think it's going to roll it into my:0,1
damage that my damage versus dexterity:0,1
2d6 so I'm it's the dexterity check:0,1
against your damage yeah so eight ten:0,1
Bren sir:0,1
alright so it still has there's no moss:0,1
in its head and there's moss on a chisel:0,1
orders there's a piece of moss on its:0,1
back and there's a piece of this more of:0,1
a fungus it's on this one's leg marmots:0,1
back so I'm going to take a swing at the:0,1
at the one on it like with a swing of:0,1
twenty one hit you'll damage to it:0,1
though damage is 1111 you hit it you:0,1
physically hit the moss and you knock:0,1
off everything except a single strand it:0,1
is barely dangling on if I don't act the:0,1
same mosey on twelve is the Miss:0,1
unfortunately yeah all right I'm gonna:0,1
stay where I am stronger their own shoot:0,1
you're right fire dang 12 is obviously:0,1
Oh miss miss I'm gonna say I'm gonna:0,1
shoot again come on come on:0,1
Gary there you go that's what I'm:0,1
talking about:0,1
uh 28 yeah that's it it was a wine you:0,1
don't even need a roll damage because:0,1
it's got one left:0,1
so you can get more than one hope you:0,1
got a one-way well no known you need to:0,1
technically get two because it's got:0,1
damage resistance that's against:0,1
anything that's not fire pretty much so:0,1
real 12 ei last arrows do that little:0,1
thread that I was hanging am i there:0,1
look that's right through saying so ever:0,1
and that little piece of angry moss gets:0,1
flung way out there this really hard to:0,1
take off I glued it on and it's knocked:0,1
off and the elemental was it looks like:0,1
it's fighting against stuff that start:0,1
to it back up one and my turn:0,1
technically would be like always turned:0,1
she's been waiting for you to move you:0,1
Nico said move forward when I move:0,1
forward you nicely and backward after I:0,1
moved oh well she got that confused:0,1
she's moving up but just keeping her:0,1
distance holding her acts in a very:0,1
threatening fashion great this she's:0,1
putting back to mr. elemental and he:0,1
takes one artist she got an older:0,1
between miss you duck I don't know did:0,1
he doc I got it:0,1

its turn okay:0,1
Dexter you save person 16 to see if:0,1
things burn 16 it is 16 coming right up:0,1
six and so it gets caught in your:0,1
flaming sphere and starts burning it's:0,1
back it's like ah it's not it's an:0,1
elemental this time just like seven:0,1
points - and the four lights on fire and:0,1
just tiny little embers of the blow away:0,1
in the wind and suddenly the old mental:1,0
goals are wonderful and it just like:1,0
falls on its knees and just sits there:1,0
still I move this here or to this fungus:1,0
right there on the stone it just:1,0
shrivels up and continue that to the:1,0
next fungus perception check anymore:1,0
fungus you have a slim piece down there:1,0
all the one blend out my eyes some:1,0
fungus got in my eye again tell them:1,0

off my glove mm-hmm and I placed my hand:1,0
slowly on top of it we do that what do I:1,0
feel it's like warm it's like warm rock:1,0
it's just like it's just like slowly:1,0
shifting just like a very much you're:1,0
scraping of rocks I'm just gonna go like:1,0
this and kind of pet it a little bit it:1,0
goes like this toes and it looks up and:1,0
sees you right knee I lie back it stands:1,0
up back tall and sits there lumbering I:1,0
go and since it's come here to help you:1,0

stuff like that but pretty much:1,0
everything else buzzing and piercing:1,0
slashing everything it's got a:1,0
resistance because it's made out of rock:1,0
what are we going to name it name it:1,0
also in maybe another situation you:1,0
could imagine this thing plowing through:1,0
buildings in fact it's a siege monster:1,0
that's how it deals double damage to:1,0
structures basically okay um so it's:1,0
