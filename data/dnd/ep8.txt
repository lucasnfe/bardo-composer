the first location which you were going:calm
to visit and try and find allies is a:calm
small cave that resides on the side of:calm
the valley with you travel the aid of:calm
the druid yet-to-be-named since there:calm
has been no word spoken between you and:calm
her:calm
and the newly named tikkun tak who are:calm
actually just kobold miners walking:calm
through the woods the trees start to:calm
part and you see a small rocky:calm
outcropping on the side of the hill so I:calm
take it you know our name so what is:calm
your name and she said not your name:calm
she's like staring straight at me:calm
well I mean like in my recognition I:calm
gotta look over here to talk to her okay:calm
she says my name is Olga I care to reiax:calm
I had a feeling your name was all go:calm
she's pretty Bush but she looks like she:calm
could get kicks and fucking oh I can:calm
tell by her voice she kick some ass you:calm

beast that we're looking for not at all:calm
sounds good let's do this we can see:calm
through the trees little bit here so I'm:suspense
just gonna roll a perception of um yeah:suspense
it's a strange-looking cave never seen:suspense
caves twelve perception looking forward:suspense
to those caves see if we can identify:suspense
where the Beast is or any night then:suspense
what do you see before you is a bunch of:suspense
rocks all piled up you can see a small:suspense
opening in the center and generally a:suspense
small black hole there all right we're:suspense
gonna we're gonna have head up we get up:suspense
to the distance there and just call out:suspense
you know hello there your silence:suspense
you hear the mountain wind blowing:suspense
between the rocks slight whistling based:suspense
on the Lana's words we can probably walk:suspense
up there on the creature like we want to:suspense
kill us:suspense
I suggest we not walk in as an entire:suspense
party is just we approach it with few:suspense
numbers single-file tic-tac Olga you:suspense

perception perception is a solid 14 14:suspense
well you can see what looks like to be:suspense
rocky outcroppings you see a little bit:suspense
of like mossy kind of overgrowth some:suspense
unsent of the rocks right in the center:suspense
here it's a small it's a small black:suspense
hole looks like you have to hunched over:suspense
to get inside it's maybe only about 4:suspense
feet tall okay:suspense

rumbling within the rocks you hear the:agitated
sound and rock elemental bursts out of:agitated
the rocks goes into the ground and:agitated
burrows itself in only to pop out a few:agitated

the earth elemental super pissed off now:agitated
C's brand in its path and it takes one:agitated
arm it's still raging swings with up arm:agitated
does a 22 hit 22 it yes and it swings:agitated
with its other arm and 11 doesn't hit:agitated
that's for sure one of the great huge:agitated
arms comes down and hits you and deals:agitated
you 15 points of damage:agitated
okay it's a giant piece of rock just:agitated
slamming into you now it's no Keith:agitated

the street you are in so far away I'm:agitated
still within six feet of the case:agitated
Coggins tango ah this big five-foot big:agitated
flaming spear lice and fire and then I:agitated
move it and goes sweeping across and:agitated
hits this creature and the other:agitated
creatures that are on this creature:agitated
think it's going to roll it into my:agitated
damage that my damage versus dexterity:agitated
2d6 so I'm it's the dexterity check:agitated
against your damage yeah so eight ten:agitated
Bren sir:agitated
alright so it still has there's no moss:agitated
in its head and there's moss on a chisel:agitated
orders there's a piece of moss on its:agitated
back and there's a piece of this more of:agitated
a fungus it's on this one's leg marmots:agitated
back so I'm going to take a swing at the:agitated
at the one on it like with a swing of:agitated
twenty one hit you'll damage to it:agitated
though damage is 1111 you hit it you:agitated
physically hit the moss and you knock:agitated
off everything except a single strand it:agitated
is barely dangling on if I don't act the:agitated
same mosey on twelve is the Miss:agitated

Gary there you go that's what I'm:agitated
talking about:agitated
uh 28 yeah that's it it was a wine you:agitated
don't even need a roll damage because:agitated
it's got one left:agitated
so you can get more than one hope you:agitated
got a one-way well no known you need to:agitated
technically get two because it's got:agitated
damage resistance that's against:agitated
anything that's not fire pretty much so:agitated
real 12 ei last arrows do that little:agitated
thread that I was hanging am i there:agitated
look that's right through saying so ever:agitated
and that little piece of angry moss gets:agitated
flung way out there this really hard to:agitated
take off I glued it on and it's knocked:agitated
off and the elemental was it looks like:agitated
it's fighting against stuff that start:agitated
to it back up one and my turn:agitated
technically would be like always turned:agitated
she's been waiting for you to move you:agitated
Nico said move forward when I move:agitated
forward you nicely and backward after I:agitated
moved oh well she got that confused:agitated
she's moving up but just keeping her:agitated

flaming sphere and starts burning it's:agitated
back it's like ah it's not it's an:agitated
elemental this time just like seven:agitated
points - and the four lights on fire and:agitated
just tiny little embers of the blow away:agitated
in the wind and suddenly the old mental:calm
goals are wonderful and it just like:calm
falls on its knees and just sits there:calm

temporary Ally and he's pretty huge a:calm
big deal it's kind of a big deal:calm
probably everything I've ever seen:calm
you've now gained another ally well we:calm
can only shake hands without there and:calm
most of all hands without you guys:calm
rather than turning towards the side of:calm
evil you have found your way in nature:calm
and made allies with the beasts that:calm
naturally reside in your land therefore:calm
creating a much stronger alliance than:calm
you could have ever had by dealing with:calm
those hex door cultists good practice to:calm
this next time the amount of time that:calm
it's taken to basically tame these:calm
beasts has eaten in to the amount of:calm
time you'll have to plan for the battle:calm
